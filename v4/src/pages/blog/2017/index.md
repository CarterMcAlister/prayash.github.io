2017 turned out to be quite the year! After spending many years (5 to be exact) at the University of Colorado Boulder studying Computer Science and Digital Media, I'm happy to say that I'm finally done with school. I'll forever see myself as a student regardless of whether I'm in school or not. There's so many fascinating things to learn about that there isn't nearly enough hours in the day. Academia was never my forte so I always gravitated towards learning by doing instead of studying for exams or doing homework assignments. Regardless, I'm grateful for the experience and all the personal growth I went through.

_My old room for most of my college career. Good memories here._

In the midst of trying to finish school/final exams on a scramble, I was desperately looking for a full time job. It took me precisely 43 job interviews, only 2 of which turned into legitimate offers. Now, I'm makin' stuff at [Viget](http://viget.com), a full-service interactive agency that specializes in custom web software and hardware. It's been such a trip working with really talented people these past 6 months, and I'm excited to see where my journey with Viget leads to.

I've had the opportunity to make some really cool stuff at Viget. Tech wise, I'm heavily exploring JavaScript and React, two pieces of technology which have had really an impact on me from an artistic and engineering perspective. It's an exciting time to be building software for the Web. There's so many avenues to explore, but for me, it's always been about making art. I've been exploring a lot of WebGL, GLSL, WebVR, and Mobile AR. I think the ideal day for me would be to spend half of it programming graphics and the other half playing music.

Something really cool that I got to take part in this year was a VR/AR Hackathon at the MIT Media Lab. Our team ended up placing third for the Everyday Mobile AR Hack Award by Samsung for our project [Luminate](https://devpost.com/software/luminate). It was a really hectic but fun experience and I'm definitely looking forward to attending more hackathons in the future.

Onto music ‚Äì

Now that I have no academic commitments, it's been much easier to allocate time for music. The electro-acoustic stuff that [I used to upload on SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/effulgence) is still there, but I'm honestly more focused on honing my chops on the guitar before going back to the computer. I'd also like to focus on creating more videos instead of delivering just audio. I think there's a lot to be explored in the audiovisual realm, especially once realtime software components are brought into the equation. I've got a few ideas brewing for the moment, but nothing concrete. As of right now, I have two new videos on YouTube, both made by my good friend Ben Crawford. One is about [why I do what I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHDN-TyN92U), and the other, [a 60 second fingerstyle cover of The Scientist by Coldplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PNG4Nei8CI). Check those out and hopefully it gives you a better sense of what I'm into.

Traveling is fun. Ever since my [study abroad trip to Argentina](http://prayash.io/blog/undiscovered-colors), I've had the itch to visit new, unfamiliar places. It's always really inspiring to travel and come back to things with a fresh and recalibrated perspective.

So, here's to hoping the trend will continue in 2018. Looking forward to more art, more music, more traveling, and more living in general. üëç
