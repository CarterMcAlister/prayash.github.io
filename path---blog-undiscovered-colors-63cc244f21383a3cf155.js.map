The bus driver let me know that we had arrived at my destination. I asked him to assist me in finding the exact door since it was my first time in the country and I’m a student with an assigned home. He happily got out and made sure that someone was home expecting me. We rang the doorbell and my host mother cheerily popped her head out the window with excitement. The bus driver wished me luck and went on his way. The door opened and there she was, a short, jolly, middle-age woman with a sweet, raspy voice. She embraced me at first sight and welcome me. We clicked right away. She showed me my room, gave me a tour of her lovely house, and served me some warm dinner (pastel del carne) with a refreshing glass of wine. We conversed about the whole fiasco I had just experienced. She could not speak English, so lucky for me, I was forced to speak in Spanish the whole time. She spoke slowly and with clarity, which helped me understand her much better and also helped me regain my previously lost confidence in my Spanish skills. I got extremely lucky with my host mom, she was everything I wanted. While I was bummed that I didn’t have a perfect family to live with, I was gifted with the hospitality of the most affectionate and amiable host-mom I could asked for. We developed an incredibly strong bond, and every single night of dinner consisted of lively conversations spanning a variety of topics ranging from adversity, love, family, dreams, tragedy, politics, history, consciousness and spirituality amongst other things.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-babde.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; \\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.5625%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-babde.jpg 960w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\nThe view from the backyard.</p>\\n<p>Rosario is a beautiful city.

Of course. Did I doubt myself? No doubt about it. But something inside of my felt that it was the right thing to do. I knew it would help me grow as a person if I traveled alone, and it would definitely take me out of my comfort zone.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/7323fe9a0ccbaf1240b109d73d77b06e-babde.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; \\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.45833333333333%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"The majestic Cerro Fitz Roy\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/7323fe9a0ccbaf1240b109d73d77b06e-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/7323fe9a0ccbaf1240b109d73d77b06e-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/7323fe9a0ccbaf1240b109d73d77b06e-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/7323fe9a0ccbaf1240b109d73d77b06e-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/7323fe9a0ccbaf1240b109d73d77b06e-babde.jpg 960w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\nThe majestic Cerro Fitz Roy.

And so began the long ride to Rosario.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/eb9cc65ad78c511c98a8eba3bfbd3933-babde.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; \\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.45833333333333%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"La casa de Pueyrrédon\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/eb9cc65ad78c511c98a8eba3bfbd3933-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/eb9cc65ad78c511c98a8eba3bfbd3933-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/eb9cc65ad78c511c98a8eba3bfbd3933-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/eb9cc65ad78c511c98a8eba3bfbd3933-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/eb9cc65ad78c511c98a8eba3bfbd3933-babde.jpg 960w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\nHome for the next 5 weeks.</p>\\n<p>I arrived late at night in Rosario with my phone dead and an address of my host family’s home. The bus driver let me know that we had arrived at my destination. I asked him to assist me in finding the exact door since it was my first time in the country and I’m a student with an assigned home. He happily got out and made sure that someone was home expecting me. We rang the doorbell and my host mother cheerily popped her head out the window with excitement. The bus driver wished me luck and went on his way. The door opened and there she was, a short, jolly, middle-age woman with a sweet, raspy voice. She embraced me at first sight and welcome me. We clicked right away. She showed me my room, gave me a tour of her lovely house, and served me some warm dinner (pastel del carne) with a refreshing glass of wine. We conversed about the whole fiasco I had just experienced. She could not speak English, so lucky for me, I was forced to speak in Spanish the whole time. She spoke slowly and with clarity, which helped me understand her much better and also helped me regain my previously lost confidence in my Spanish skills. I got extremely lucky with my host mom, she was everything I wanted. While I was bummed that I didn’t have a perfect family to live with, I was gifted with the hospitality of the most affectionate and amiable host-mom I could asked for. We developed an incredibly strong bond, and every single night of dinner consisted of lively conversations spanning a variety of topics ranging from adversity, love, family, dreams, tragedy, politics, history, consciousness and spirituality amongst other things.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-babde.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; \\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.5625%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/754d7a11ee2ae08b64b7caf305f03fe7-babde.jpg 960w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\nThe view from the backyard.</p>\\n<p>Rosario is a beautiful city. It’s rich in history and culture, and the nightlife is booming.

Having seen Fitz Roy in rock climbing films, I started to think that exploring Patagonia is definitely possible. I couldn’t find anyone else to go with, so I decided to go on my own. Was I nervous? Of course. Did I doubt myself? No doubt about it. But something inside of my felt that it was the right thing to do. I knew it would help me grow as a person if I traveled alone, and it would definitely take me out of my comfort zone.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/7323fe9a0ccbaf1240b109d73d77b06e-babde.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; \\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.45833333333333%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"The majestic Cerro Fitz Roy\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/7323fe9a0ccbaf1240b109d73d77b06e-ec749.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/7323fe9a0ccbaf1240b109d73d77b06e-d894e.jpg 173w,\\n/static/7323fe9a0ccbaf1240b109d73d77b06e-97c21.jpg 345w,\\n/static/7323fe9a0ccbaf1240b109d73d77b06e-ec749.jpg 690w,\\n/static/7323fe9a0ccbaf1240b109d73d77b06e-babde.jpg 960w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\nThe majestic Cerro Fitz Roy.
